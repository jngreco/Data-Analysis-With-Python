Schools that spend less than $585 dollars per student have an overal passing rate of approximately 90%, while schools that spend $645-680 on each student have an overall passing rate of 54%. However, it would be irresponsible to assume that spending less money per student causes higher scores, as there are many other variables that could be responsible for this trend, such as school size, location, grade level, etc."
